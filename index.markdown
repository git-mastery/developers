Developer documentation about all things Git-Mastery.

## What is Git-Mastery?

Git-Mastery is a Git education tool developed by the National University of Singapore School of Computing to help students master Git through hands-on, guided tours with real-world scenario exercises.

## Try Git-Mastery!

Before contributing to Git-Mastery, it would be good if you tried it out to get a sense of what students experience.

To setup Git-Mastery, refer to [this setup guide](https://git-mastery.github.io/app) for your OS.

We recommend following along with [tour 1](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/book/gitAndGithub/trail/recordingFolderHistory/index.html) and [tour 2](https://nus-cs2103-ay2526s1.github.io/website/book/gitAndGithub/trail/backingUpOnCloud/) of the NUS CS2103/T Git curriculum!

## Contributor's progression

You are welcome to start contributing to Git-Mastery in any way you see fit! 

However, if you are looking for a certain angle to start at, we recommend [contributing 1-2 hands-on](/developers/docs/contributing/hands-on) before diving into [contributing exercises](/developers/docs/contributing/exercise)!
